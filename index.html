        <li>Javascript</li>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a versatile and essential programming language that
          revolutionizes web development by adding interactivity, dynamism, and
          functionality to static websites. As one of the core building blocks
          of modern web applications, JavaScript enables developers to create
          immersive user experiences, responsive designs, and interactive
          interfaces.

        <li>HTML</li>
        <p>
          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the fundamental language of the
          web, serving as the backbone of virtually every webpage you encounter
          online. As a web developer or digital professional, a strong command
          of HTML is essential for creating and structuring web content. Here's
          why HTML proficiency is a valuable skill in today's digital landscape:
        </p>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <p>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a fundamental technology used in web
          development to control the visual presentation and layout of web
          pages. It works in conjunction with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
          to define how the content of a webpage is displayed in a web browser.

        <li>DevOps</li>
        <p>
          DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development
          (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life
          cycle and provide continuous delivery with high quality. It aims at
          establishing a culture and environment where building, testing, and
          releasing software can happen rapidly, frequently, and more reliably.

        <p>
          Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a software
          development practice that involves automatically building, testing,
          and deploying code changes to production. This ensures that changes
          are integrated and deployed quickly and with high quality, reducing
          the risk of bugs and downtime. In this guide, we will walk through the
          process of setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a web application, using
          popular tools such as Jenkins and Git.
